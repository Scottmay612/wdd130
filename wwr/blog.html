            <h2>Highlights from the past season!</h2>
            <p>
                What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

            <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
            <h3>Scorpions:</h3>
            <p>
                Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily humans are not on that list! 
            </p>
            <p>
                When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.

            <h3>Big horn sheep:</h3>
            <p>
                 For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators.Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short with a slight curvature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.

            <h2>Family fun!</h2>
            <p>
                During the month of July, we held a family party for the Jones family! Here is what they said: This year's family reunion was one to remember! We played games, went river rafting, and made dinner over the fire. Water and bathrooms were easily accessible so we were able to stay out there all day long. If you are looking for a fun family reunion location, Dry Oar can help you out!

    <h2>Scott May</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Scott May. I am currently studying to become a
        computer engineer through BYU Idaho. For fun, I love anything 
        that has to do with technology and anything that has to do with 
        sports. While I am going to school, I am working as an ASL Interpreter 
        in an elementary school. I learned sign language while serving my 
        mission in Mesa, Arizona. <p>
        
        </p>My favorite scripture is Alma 37:6-7. It
        says, "6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but 
        behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great 
        things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth 
        confound the wise.7 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring 
        about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the 
        Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of 
        many souls."
    <p>
    <p>I am excited to work with all of you!</p>
